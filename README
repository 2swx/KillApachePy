If you are following security trends then you've probably heard
about the DoS attack against major number of Apache versions by
usage of specially crafted Range header (CVE-2011-3192). Based
on the original PoC (here) I've made a Python version out of it
which is more user friendly and has few program workflow
enhancements, like (safe) automatic usage of maximum (system)
allowed thread number. So, it's nothing new. It's only properly
(re)written to suit own personal taste and from my point of view
it works better than original.

p.s. Python v2.5.x-v2.7.x is recommended for running this tool
